#+title: Thermostats at TGR

* Principle of operation

The model is SEL8300 or something, from Schneider. They control a Clima Canal
from Jaga, as well as a pump system that controls water pumping into the Jaga
units throughout the home.

The pump can be set to pump cold or hot water through the pipes, and each room
has a thermometer (probably a thermistor) that detects what temperature the
water is going through a particular Jaga unit.

Fresh hot or cold water (a.k.a. the coolant) flows into each Jaga unit, which
gets dispersed by a heat sink and a fan, which blows hot or cold air out of it.

One thermostat in a home controls the pump, and all of them control their
individual room's jaga fan speed, based on the temperature of the water.

Only one of the thermostats (at least in our 2 bedroom apartment with 3
thermostats total) is wired up to pin 12, but all the thermostats work assuming
that pin 12 is connected.

* Thermostat pins

| Pin # | Voltage           | Description                                                                 |
|-------+-------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|     5 | GND/Common        | Common for both AC and DC                                                   |
|     6 | 24 volts AC (in)  | Power source for thermostat                                                 |
|    11 | 0-10 volts DC out | Fan control (~0V~ fan off, ~10V~ fan on, current program typically uses 8V) |
|    12 | 0-10 volts DC out | Hot/cold water pump (~0V~ cold water, ~5V~ is off, ~10V~ is hot water)      |
|    24 | 0-10 volts DC in  | Temperature of the water at the Jaga unit                                   |

* Thermostat operation

Each thermostat (per room) operates independently, although they are bound by
the water pumping through the pipes (hot or cold).

There is a custom lua script (that you can see the first few lines of in the
thermostat if you go to the service menu, but no more) that is uploaded onto the
thermostat. From what I gather, it does this:

1. When the thermostat wants to cool, it will pull pin 12 to ~0V~, to get cold
   water pumping through the pipes on the entire home.
  - It will then wait for pin 24 to go to a low voltage (didn’t measure how low,
    I’d imagine it’d be < ~3V~), indicating that there is cold water through the
    pipes before turning on the fan by putting a voltage on Pin 11.
2. If the thermostat wants to heat, it will pull pin 12 to ~10V~, to get hot water
   pumping through the pipes
  - It will then wait for pin 24 to go to a high voltage (probably > ~7V~, but
    that’s speculation) to indicate hot water is flowing through the pipes
3. If the thermostat wants to turn off, it will pull pin 12 to ~5.0V~, which
   actually turns off the water pumps, so the jaga units will eventually just
   become room temperature without fresh water.
   - The fans will also turn off (~0V~ to pin 11)
4. The thermostat determines what fan speed (pin 11) based on the temperature
   difference between the set point and the current temperature (measured by the
   thermostat itself).
   - It's seemingly possible for the fan to go to ~10V~, but it rarely does (and
     is quite loud).
